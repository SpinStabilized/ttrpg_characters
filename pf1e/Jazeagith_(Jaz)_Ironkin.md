## Bio

Jazeagith Ironkin, Jaz to her friends, is a young dwarven lady that originally hails from the city of Janderhoff. Jaz comes from a family of merchants who often have to fight off various criminal elements in society. One day, when her family was dealing with a particularly troublesome group of bandits, a group who followed the teachings of Cayden Cailean helped rid the family and Janderhoff itself of criminals. Much ale was shared in celebration and her family integrated the teachings of Cayden in with their worship of Torag.
  
When Jaz was a young lady, she determined to dedicate her life to the teachings of Cayden and joined a group of human clerics to learn how to be a conduit for his teachings to help spread good throughout Golarian.
